# Transport Company App Project (EasyMode)

this project was a college project that I later developed and improved in another repository [Trasport-HardMode-](https://github.com/ahmed-elbehairy7/transport-HardMode-)

## Running the program

### Prerequists

First of all you need the java tool-kit to compile the code and so on, make sure that you have javac and java installed by typing the following command anywere in the cmd

    javac --version

and

    java --version

if they throws an error or not recognized, please go ahead and install them

### Compiling

since I needed to compile and run them alot, I already had done some scripts for compiling and running,
to compile the code, just type compile to the cmd in the src directory or in the project root directory and it should work fine. Just like this!:

    compile

### Running

I had also made another script called transport, and if you want to go with the gui, just add the argument -g or --gui after it like the following examples

    transport
    transport --gui
    transport -g

### Compiling then running

Also there was sometimes when I needed to compile then run the applicatoin directory, in order to do that, just type run in the cmd

    run
    run --gui
    run -g

as you can see, the arguments of gui applies also to this method
